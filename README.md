# The Great Tic Tac Toe

This is my very own **Tic Tac Toe game**. I'm sure you're familiar with the ruleset, but just incase I'll go over them with you again.

## RULES

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

### Good Luck!
